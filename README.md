# Web-Application-Tutorial-Report

In order to run this code you will need a few prerequisites:

1: An AWS account to use the products (Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) in the tutorial (Free tier will work just fine). 

2: A word editor to write and edit the JavaScript, HTML, and JSON files from the tutorial. 

3: And finally a web browser to use the AWS Amplifly Console which will temporarily hold your web applicaiton.
